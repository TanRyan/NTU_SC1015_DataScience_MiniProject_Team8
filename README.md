The Titanic was a British luxury passenger liner that embarked on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City on April 10, 1912³. It was the largest and most luxurious ship afloat at the time¹². 

However, just four days into the voyage, shortly before midnight on April 14, the Titanic collided with an iceberg southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland¹². Despite being considered unsinkable due to its double-bottomed hull divided into 16 watertight compartments¹, the collision caused five compartments to rupture, leading to the ship sinking in the early hours of April 15¹².

Tragically, more than 1,500 of the approximately 2,200 passengers and crew on board lost their lives in the disaster¹². The Titanic had only 1,178 lifeboat places for 2,224 passengers¹. The disaster led to significant changes in maritime regulations, including new rules requiring that the number of places in lifeboats equal the number of passengers and that all ships maintain a 24-hour radio watch for distress signals¹.

The wreck of the Titanic was discovered in 1985, lying upright in two pieces at a depth of 13,000 feet¹. The Titanic disaster has since entered the public consciousness as a cautionary tale about the perils of human hubris².
